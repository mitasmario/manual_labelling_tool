    "# Manual labelling of data\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will demostrate example of text data labelling. There might occur such situations that freshly gathered data or even long time available dataset doesn't have labels. Lot of machine learning algorithms needs labels to train model on as response variable. But even rest, all unsupervised algorithms would utilize at least small volume of labeled validation data. Therefore labelling of some part of dataset is always useful. \n",

    "## Example dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "As example we will use 100 randomly selected answers from publicly available dataset [Yahoo Answers!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M). This popular dataset was used for many text classification white papers, although it already has labels it would be good for purpose of this showcase. Our task is to select lables of of 10 possible classes. In original dataset each answer have selected jus 1 class, however our tool can select even multiple classes."

    "Once we start labelling function it will loop through given data list. Each text from data will be presented to us together with list of options. User's task is just to select one of the options by typing correct number from displayed options. First option with number -2 is Exit from labelling. If user press this option program will shut down, all records that were so far labeled will be stored in the created database and user can return later and continue with next unlabeled record. Second option -1 gives user opportunity to add new label into label list, if user press this option prompt asking to input new label will appear and user must provide it. This label will be assigned to currently displayed record and from now on it will be showed in menu as a new option. Third option 0 should be used in time when user is finished with current record. If no label was provided then this record will be completely skipped from labeled database, otherwise selections will be recorded into database. Beside of these 3 options menu will write down all labels with given numbers from 1 to length of label_list. User must type number of selected label and press enter. Then the same menu will display again asking for another label, this will repeat one more time since we decided to allow up to 3 labels to single record. If it would be appropriate to have less than 3 labels, user must press 0 to finish labelling of current record. Otherwise program would ask 3 times for each record and then would continue with next record automatically."
